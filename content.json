To be more specific, I consider myself to be a statistician, a data engineer, a machine learning practitioner, and an AI researcher (I probably can come up with more :P). I’m a Ph.D. student at the University of Oslo and working for a company in Norway called eSmart Systems at the same time. My job is to design a big data analytics architecture for IoT applications (e.g., Smart Grid), the products that my company is selling. I do multivariate time-series analysis and modeling, including forecasting and clustering. Recently, I get involved a lot in an exciting AI project called the “Drone project”, where we develop automatic line inspection solution for Utility companies using drones. It requires applying Deep Learning and AI technologies in many parts, which make me super delighted. This blog is an attempt to publish my thinking about statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence in general. Many posts will be just a set of organized random thoughts, while some others will be about how I have solved some technical issues when getting my job done.

But my procrastination power was so high that I could not manage to do so earlier. And now, since my Ph.D. is moving slowly to its end, the need to have an updated detail CV in the form of a blog has finally created enough kick-ass force.

Many posts will be just a set of organized random thoughts, while some others will be about how I have solved some technical issues when getting my job done. I will try to have correct references for any idea that I would ever come up with. But sometimes, some ideas emerge naturally after I have consumed enough information from many sources. At that point, searching back for all of the sources would be impossible for me. It would not be hard for you to find some ideas in this blog that use weird vocabulary. The ideas might have been studied extensively for many years without my notice. Please tell me when that happens, I would be very appreciated.","categories":[],"tags":[],"keywords":[]}]}
